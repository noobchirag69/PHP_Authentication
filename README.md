# PHP_Authentication
A dashboard system built with Vanilla PHP and MySQL. It has the features of registering new accounts and logging in to existing accounts. It also has the features of updating user profile and changing passwords. It uses PHPMailer to send a temporary password to the registered email accounts of users in case of password recovery.

To use this code:
1. Download this code and extract the contents of the ZIP file in your 'C://xampp/htdocs' folder.
2. Create a database named 'dashboard_panel' in your phpmyadmin.
3. Import the database dump file (dashboard_panel.sql) inside that newly created database.
4. You're good to go. Cheers!
